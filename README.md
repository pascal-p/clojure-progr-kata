## How to Do the Katas

Forked repo. Using Leiningen
Each of the katas are in their own directory and are self contained Clojure leiningen projects.
`cd` into the project and run `lein test` to show the failing tests, then complete the code
to make the tests pass. Each project has the instructions in its own _README.md_ file.
